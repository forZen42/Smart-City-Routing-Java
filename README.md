# Smart City Routing System 🚀

Developed by: **Berat Yaylacı** Student ID: **230212056** University: **İstanbul Okan University**

## 🛠 Project Overview
This project is a Java-based simulation of an urban routing engine, developed within the context of **CENG 203 (Data Structures)** and **CENG 319 (Algorithm Analysis)** courses. It utilizes **Graph Theory** to manage urban station connectivity and simulate pathfinding optimization.

## 🧠 Key Technical Concepts
- **Data Structure:** Implemented using an **Adjacency List** model via `Map<String, List<String>>`.
- **Optimization Logic:** Designed around **Dijkstra’s Algorithm** principles for shortest path simulation.
- **Java Fundamentals:** Advanced use of **Generics**, **HashMaps**, and **Collection API**.
